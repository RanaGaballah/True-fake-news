## Introduction

The True-fake-news repository offers a comprehensive solution for detecting and classifying news articles as true or fake. By utilizing machine learning algorithms and a curated dataset of labeled news articles, we have developed a model that can make accurate predictions regarding the authenticity of news content. This project can be used as a basis for building applications or services that combat the spread of misinformation and enable users to verify the credibility of news articles.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess news articles to remove noise and irrelevant information.
- Feature extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed articles to represent them numerically.
- Model training: Train a machine learning model using the labeled dataset to classify news articles.
- Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the authenticity of new, unseen news articles.
- Web interface (optional): Build a web interface for users to interact with the model and verify the credibility of news articles.

## Installation

To use the True-fake-news project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RanaGaballah/True-fake-news.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file. You can use pip to install them:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the labeled dataset of news articles and place it in the appropriate directory.

4. Run the preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the news articles:
   ```
   python preprocess.py
   ```

5. Run the feature extraction script to extract relevant features from the preprocessed articles:
   ```
   python feature_extraction.py
   ```

6. Train the machine learning model using the labeled dataset and the extracted features:
   ```
   python train_model.py
   ```

7. Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics:
   ```
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

8. Use the trained model to predict the authenticity of new, unseen news articles:
   ```
   python predict.py
   ```

9. (Optional) Build a web interface to interact with the model and provide news verification functionality.

## Usage

To use the True-fake-news project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have completed the installation steps mentioned above.

2. Prepare the news article you want to verify by cleaning and preprocessing it.

3. Extract relevant features from the preprocessed article using the feature extraction script.

4. Load the trained model and use it to predict the authenticity of the article.

5. Review the prediction result and make informed decisions based on the model's classification.

6. (Optional) If you have built the web interface, use it to conveniently verify the credibility of news articles.
